        <div class="post-content">
            <p>It's no secret that Pakistan isn't exactly the most tolerant country when it comes to freedom of speech and expression.  <span id="continue-reading"></span> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1551250">We rank at 145</a> out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom index, and have historically been one of the least tolerant countries in terms of religion or even just views in general differing to theirs. I want to go in-depth into just the plain horrible state of how heavily censored Pakistani internet is, though I will also be touching on entertainment media in general as well, because that is what prompted me to write this in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="denial">Denial</h2>
<p>The (ex) Prime Minister <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1497391">constantly denied</a> any authoritative internet or media censorship in Pakistan during his tenure and said <code>talking about curbs on press freedom in Pakistan is a ‚Äújoke‚Äù</code>. This is the same prime minister in who's tenure <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1507590"><strong>over 900,000 websites</strong> were banned</a> for  &quot;reasons such as carrying blasphemous and pornographic content and/or sentiments against the state, judiciary or the armed forces&quot;. These websites under the guise of immoral content or sentiment against the state included indian news websites, secular websites, and sites containing government-decided &quot;immoral content&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="abuse">Abuse</h2>
<p>&quot;Immoral content&quot; and &quot;Anti-state sentiment&quot; has been a vice for the government to ban whatever they please at will, and there have been several times in recent years where social media was entirely temporarily banned due to political reasons such at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Tehreek-e-Labaik_protest">Tahreek-Labbaik Protest</a> and sometimes even <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/7/10/media-watchdogs-slam-brazen-censorship-by-pakistan">shutting down television channels broadcasting the oppositions views</a>. Only news in favour of the regime is allowed to be posted in the news, and heavy political instability has lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Pakistan#History">frequent changes in media censorship legislation</a> for those in power to remain in power.</p>
<h2 id="random-acts-of-censorship">Random Acts of Censorship</h2>
<p>Although I am obviously uncomfortable with this censorship, I could at the very least tolerate it if it did not affect me. However, this censorship is so insanely dumb, that websites such as <a href="https://pastebin.com">PasteBin</a>, <a href="https://deviantart.com">DeviantArt</a> have been banned for no reason at all specified by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, and websites like <a href="https://tiktok.com">TikTok</a> were banned over &quot;immoral content&quot;.</p>
<p>Even video games like Player Unknowns Battlegrounds were temporarily banned, and the ban was not lifted until millions of Pakistani's flooded social media with it. This censorship is so authoratative and dystopian that it's not even funny at this point. It's insanely stupid how censorship is this heavy and theres only a tiny vocal minority actually speaking out for it.</p>
<p>The Pakistani government even tried to ban Virtual Private Network's under the pretense that it was an action that was being undertaken ‚Äúto promote legal ICT services/business in Pakistan and safety of telecom users‚Äù. Yeah right, safety my ass. Thankfully, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority has zero clue as to what the hell they're doing so they werent able to enforce the plans they had.</p>
<h2 id="blasphemy-laws">Blasphemy Laws</h2>
<p>Pakistan also has infamous laws for the punishment of blasphemy and apostasy. The law for punishment ranges from a fine to a straight up death penalty by hanging, and has received international criticism worldwide. Ex-muslim websites, youtubers and any trace of criticism of Islam has been banned, and over 75 people have been murdered over it since 1987. Shia websites such as <a href="https://www.shiachat.com/">ShiaChat</a> have been banned. News sources that are <strong>secular</strong> and speak out for the constant oppression and persecution over minorities such as the <a href="https://www.rabwah.net/">Rabwah Times</a> have been banned under the guide of &quot;blasphemy&quot; and false blasphemy cases are widespread in the judicial system.</p>
<h2 id="censorship-is-fine-rolling-eyes">Censorship is Fine üôÑ</h2>
<p>No, it's not. This heading sounds dumb, but its a common sentiment among many Pakistani's ive engaged in conversation with. First of all, it is not the state's job AT ALL to censor media to such a great extent. Yes, some countries disallow heavy anti-state sentiment (though i dont agree with that either), banning views different to yours is one of the most close-minded things you can do, whether that be through <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/565879/pakistan-government-using-netsweeper-for-internet-filtering-report">running NetSweeper at a national level</a> or banning any form of secular discussion.</p>
<p>It's the same as when the United States <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States">tried to ban alchohol in the 1920's</a> and caused hundreds of black markets to start operations. Prohibition and censorship is like closing your eyes and putting earplugs in your ears and pretending something that is clearly there never exists, while simultaneously causing people to crowd around you curious about what you're blocking yourself from. Just because the state does not agree with something, doesn't mean they can censor it, that is a pill in a box of reality checks that is too hard to swallow for people here, and will ultimately come to bite us in the back.</p>
